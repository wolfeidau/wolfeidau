Gday! 👋

I'm Mark Wolfe a Software Developer, Writer and a Communicator based in Melbourne, Australia. 😎️🦘️

I previously worked at [Stax](https://www.stax.io/) as an engineering lead, currently in limbo between gigs, was primarily building software in and around the [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) with a team of talented people. 

In my spare time I share a **lot** of smaller projects solving interesting problems I encounter, these are mostly focused around AWS☁️, the web🌐️, data📜️ and distributed systems🤯️, and are open source🎁️. I often write code in [Go](https:/go.dev), but also dabble in Javascript, Typescript, Python, C and C++, along with a few others.
